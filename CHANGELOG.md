## 0.0.1-dev.1

* Initial implementation of the flutter hrv

## 0.0.1-dev.2

* Added Frequency Domain values 
* Frequency Domain Analysis technique that shows how much of a signal lies within one or more frequency bands (ranges).

* Common Frequency Domain HRV metrics include:

* High-Frequency power (HF): frequency activity in the 0.15 - 0.40Hz range
* Low-Frequency power (LF): frequency activity in the 0.04 - 0.15Hz range
* LF/HF Ratio: A ratio of Low Frequency to High Frequency.
